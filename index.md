Welcome to the "Type Ia supernova in the Near-Infrared" workshop webpage.

This workshop will be held in the Astronomy Department of the University of Pittsburgh from April 11 to 13, 2018. We aim to gather together 25 SN researchers of LSST institutions and from the broad SN community to discuss about the new problems and needs that people working with LSST data will have to face, and also on developing a plan of how we can collaborate to cover future analysis/tests.

With this workshop we aim to:

-Prepare SN researchers for LSST data analysis,

-Provide the SN community with state of the art analysis tools, 

-Make synergistic connections with ongoing and future cosmological surveys, and

-Make progress on LSST SN roadmap tasks.

This workshop will serve specially to engage SN researchers from LSST institutions that do not have started to work in LSST-related science but that are willing to start investing part of their time in it. In addition, it will serve as a first taste of what LSST can provide for their research projects, provide the chance to learn about how to use current tools, and discuss with other SN researchers about what is needed, and to what they can contribute.

Limited travel funds that will partially cover travel and accommodation expenses are available for early career scientists who wish to attend. Please fill the corresponding box in the registration form (REGISTRATION IS NOW CLOSED).
 
We will broadcast the talks throughout the workshop via BlueJeans, using the usual DESC SN WG room number. Please, contact llgalbany at pitt dot edu for details.

This workshop is funded by a grant from the LSST Corporation through the Enabling Science program. For more details on this program, see https://lsstcorporation.org/enabling-science


## Rationale

Optical observations of SNe Ia have been widely used in the last decades to measure cosmological distances, and have been key in measuring the Hubble constant and demonstratibg cosmic acceleration. In recent years, the literature sample of optical SN Ia at cosmological distances has grown substantially, and at this point statistical errors are comparable to systematic uncertainties. Further improvement in reducing these systematic errors would require a much better understanding of the physical model of the ex- plosion, which is still incomplete, a direct observational constraint on which kind of progenitors can produce SNe Ia, which is still lacking, as well as a better control of reddening effects due to interstellar and/or circum- stellar dust.

Increasing evidence suggests that SNIa are very nearly ‘natural’ standard candles at NIR wavelengths, even before correction for light-curve shape or reddening, yielding more precise distance estimates to their host galaxies than optical data alone. Compared to the optical, SNe Ia in the NIR are both better standard candles (σH ∼0.12), and relatively immune to the effects of extinction and reddening by dust (extinction corrections are by a factor of 4-6 smaller than in the optical). However, SNe Ia cosmology in the NIR is still poorly developed compared to the optical, since current efforts are focused on increasing the number of objects and are constrained to low redshifts (z<0.2).

We propose a 3-day workshop to bring together ~20 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observeational and theoretical experts from the two near-infrared (NIR) leading surveys to discuss about on-going analyses, unexplained issues, and future plans regarding SN Ia cosmology in the NIR.
 
Because dust and color are the biggest topic of debate, discussion, and confusion in SNe Ia today reducing sensitivity to dust is a significant gain in the power of luminosity-distance measurements to constraint the dark energy equation-of-state parameter. We propose a 3 day workshop to bring together the latest observational groups in Type Ia supernovae in the near infrared along with theorists and modelers working actively in this field to best understand and exploit the new data and insights to tackle the biggest systematic
uncertainty in Type Ia supernova cosmology.

Two surveys are currently leading the effort of compiling statistical samples of SNe Ia observed in the NIR: The Carnegie Supernova Project is currently analysing the data from their second dataset (CSP-II) which, together with the CSP-I data, contain more tan 150 low- z SNe Ia observed from Las Campanas Observatory (Chile) in the NIR. The SweetSpot Survey (PI: Wood-Vasey) has recently delivered the first data release containing light-curves of 74 SNe Ia followed up in the NIR. The observations and analysis for this program have been led by Pitt-PACC graduate students Anja Weyant and Kara Ponder. In adition, Kara Ponder has observed 30 SweetSpot host galaxies with the Integral Field Unit Hexpak at the Kitt Peak observatory, and Lluís Galbany is currently obtaining Integral Field Spectroscopy data of SweetSpot SN host galaxies with several instruments around the world (PMAS, Spain; MUSE, Chile; KOALA, Australia). The second and last SweetSpot data release containing the full set of 114 SNe Ia is forseen for late 2017.

It will be very timely to bring these groups together to discuss how to extract the best science out of the data sets and how to ensure consistent calibration and agreement across the datasets This makes Pitt a natural place to have this workshop while bringing internationally-recognized experts in at the time of the second SweetSpot data release.
 


## Venue

The workshop will be held at the University Club on the University of Pittsburgh campus, address: 123 University Pl, Pittsburgh, PA 15260.

Getting to the Hotel/University Club:
There are several options for reaching the Hotel from the Pittsburgh International Airport.  A taxi should cost ~$50-60, while Uber or Lyft should be ~$30-40.  Super Shuttle is ~$25 for a shared ride van.  There is a Port Authority bus line from the airport with stops near the hotel, the 28X (link) that runs every half hour from 5:30 am to midnight.  The fare is only $3.75, though the trip will take slightly longer than an hour. Exit the bus at Forbes and Schenley Drive (by a large Diplodocus dinosaur statue), the Wyndham hotel is then on the opposite side of the Cathedral of Learning, the 42-story building at the center of Pitt's campus.

Hotel:
We have arranged for a block of rooms at the Wyndham University Center Pittsburgh, just two blocks from the meeting location (map), for the nights of 11/15-11/18.  Those wishing to book after registration for the conference has been confirmed, do not contact the hotel directly. Instead, please email Cindy Cercone at cmc138@pitt.edu with which nights you wish to reserve. She will make reservations and send you a confirmation number with the hotel, along with further travel details.  The discounted room rate is $145+tax.

You must email Cindy by October 20th in order to receive the discounted room rate.

## Program

We will have time for introductory talks, discussion on particular topics, and hands-on sessions. Summarizing, there will be:

6:30h of talks, thought to show current interests and the stage of ongoing/finished analyses.

4:00h of time for discussion, thought to comment on the work presented and to draw detailed plans for specific tasks on the topic.

5:00h of tutorials (or hands-on sessions), given by members that are already involved in the LSST SN group, and thought to provide the attendants with the existing tools and for making substantial progress on coding.
